d3-MQTT-Topic-Tree
==================

A MQTT Topic Tree viewer using the d3 collapsable tree and MQTT over websockets

-- d3
The Collapasable tree orginally came from here:
http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/tree.html

I've wrapped it with a little code to allow for dynamically adding nodes and to add the topic segments to each node.
